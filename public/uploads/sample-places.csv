16th Avenue Steps,1700 16th Ave,San Francisco,California,United States,37.75612,-122.47338,16ATS_01.jpg,"The 16th Avenue Tiled Steps project has been a neighborhood collaboration  to create a sea to stars themed mosaic flowing up a 163 step stairway located in San Francisco's Golden Gate Heights Neighborhood. Neighborhood residents Jessie Audette and Alice Yee Xavier started the project in 2003 in a grassroots effort to connect the neighbors in a community project to beautify Golden Gate Heights.      
 
The neighbors chose artists Aileen Barr and Colette Crutcher to collaborate in the creation of a design on 163 mosaic panels. Neighbors sponsored handmade named tiles in the shapes of the animals, fish, shells within the mosaic.
Tile sponsorship provided the funding for the majority of the project.  Three mosaic workshops were held in the community so that all could participate in the making of the mosaic panels.",http://www.16thavenuetiledsteps.com/,"1010,1100,1700,1900,1910",Free,00:01,21:59,Morning,"Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat",None,0.5,No,2
